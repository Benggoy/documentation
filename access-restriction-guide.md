# Access Restriction Verification
# ==============================

**BEFORE Restriction:**
- Claude had access to: `/Users/benitomartinlopez/Documents/` (full)
- Files accessible: 773+ files across entire Documents folder
- Risk level: HIGH - All personal/business documents visible

**AFTER Restriction:**
- Claude access limited to: `/Users/benitomartinlopez/Documents/Claude-Access/`
- Files accessible: Only files you specifically place in Claude-Access
- Risk level: LOW - Controlled access to approved files only

## Verification Steps:

1. **Update config file** (manual step)
2. **Restart Claude Desktop**
3. **Test access limitation** - Claude should only see Claude-Access folder
4. **Verify old Documents access denied**

## Test Commands After Restart:
```
"List all files you can access"
"Try to read a file outside Claude-Access folder"  
"Show me your current access scope"
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Claude can only access Claude-Access folder contents
- ‚ùå Claude cannot access broader Documents folder
- üîí Access properly restricted and secure

---
**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Next:** Restart Claude Desktop after config change
