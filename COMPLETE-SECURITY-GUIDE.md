# Claude MCP Complete Security Implementation Guide
# ================================================

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### ⚡ CRITICAL FIRST STEPS (Do These Now):

#### 1. **🔒 RESTRICT ACCESS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
```bash
# Backup current config
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.backup

# Edit config file
open -a TextEdit ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Replace content with:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/benitomartinlopez/Documents/Claude-Access"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Then restart Claude Desktop** (Cmd+Q, reopen)

#### 2. **🔍 RUN FIRST SECURITY SCAN**
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x ~/Documents/Claude-Access/Monitoring/*.sh

# Run interactive security scan
~/Documents/Claude-Access/Monitoring/interactive-security-scan.sh
```

#### 3. **🧠 AUDIT MEMORY SYSTEM**
Ask Claude: `"Show me the complete knowledge graph with read_graph"`

#### 4. **🤖 SET UP AUTOMATION**
```bash
# Run automation setup
~/Documents/Claude-Access/Monitoring/setup-automation.sh

# Schedule weekly scans
crontab -e
# Add: 0 9 * * 1 /Users/benitomartinlopez/Documents/Claude-Access/Monitoring/weekly-auto-monitor.sh
```

## 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### ✅ **System Setup Verification:**

- [ ] **Access Restricted:** Claude config updated to Claude-Access only
- [ ] **Claude Restarted:** Fresh session with new access controls
- [ ] **Scripts Executable:** All monitoring scripts have execute permissions
- [ ] **First Scan Complete:** Initial security scan run successfully
- [ ] **Memory Audited:** Knowledge graph checked for stored information
- [ ] **Automation Scheduled:** Weekly monitoring cron job configured

### ✅ **Security Test Verification:**

- [ ] **Access Test:** Ask Claude "What files can you access?"
  - ✅ Expected: Only Claude-Access folder contents
  - ❌ Failure: Still sees full Documents folder

- [ ] **Memory Test:** Ask Claude "What do you remember about me?"
  - ✅ Expected: Limited/controlled information only
  - ❌ Failure: Sensitive personal details stored

- [ ] **Monitoring Test:** Check Reports folder exists and populates
  - ✅ Expected: Weekly security reports generated
  - ❌ Failure: No reports or automation not working

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### **If Security Breach Suspected:**

#### Immediate Actions (< 1 minute):
```bash
# 1. Disable all Claude tools
# Go to Claude Settings → Toggle OFF "Disable all tools"

# 2. OR remove config entirely
rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# 3. Kill Claude process
pkill -f "Claude"
```

#### Investigation (< 5 minutes):
```bash
# Check recent file access
find ~/Documents -mtime -1 -type f

# Review conversation history in Claude
# Check monitoring logs
cat ~/Documents/Claude-Access/Monitoring/monitoring-history.log
```

#### Recovery (< 15 minutes):
```bash
# Move sensitive files to secure location
mkdir ~/Private-Secure
mv ~/Documents/sensitive-files/* ~/Private-Secure/

# Reset Claude configuration with minimal access
# Audit and clear Claude memory completely
```

## 📅 ONGOING SECURITY ROUTINE

### **Daily (30 seconds):**
- Quick check: Claude settings unchanged
- Spot check: No unexpected file modifications

### **Weekly (5 minutes):**
- Review automated security report
- Check for security alerts in Reports folder  
- Verify Claude access still restricted

### **Monthly (15 minutes):**
- Complete security checklist audit
- Memory system deep clean
- Update access controls if needed
- Review and archive old monitoring reports

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

### **🟢 SECURE CONFIGURATION:**
- Claude access limited to Claude-Access folder only
- Weekly security reports generating clean status
- Memory system contains minimal, appropriate information
- No sensitive files accessible to Claude

### **🟡 NEEDS ATTENTION:**
- Partial access restriction
- Occasional security warnings in reports
- Some personal information in memory system
- Manual monitoring only (no automation)

### **🔴 SECURITY RISK:**
- Full Documents folder access still enabled
- No monitoring or alerting in place
- Sensitive information stored in memory
- No access controls or audit trail
