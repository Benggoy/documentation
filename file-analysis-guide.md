### 2. **File Reading**
- `read_file` - Read single files
- `read_multiple_files` - Read several files at once
- `edit_file` - Make changes to files

### 3. **Analysis Engine**
- `repl` (Analysis Tool) - JavaScript analysis engine for processing data
- Complex calculations and data manipulation
- CSV/JSON parsing and analysis
- Pattern recognition and insights

## üîç Step-by-Step Analysis Examples

### **Example 1: Configuration File Analysis**

**Step 1:** Read the file
```
Ask: "Can you read my config.json file in the trading-platform folder?"
```

**Step 2:** Analyze with code
```
Ask: "Use the analysis tool to extract key metrics from this configuration"
```

**Result:** Detailed breakdown of settings, risk parameters, and recommendations

### **Example 2: Log File Analysis**

**Step 1:** Find log files
```
Ask: "Search for all .log files in my directories"
```

**Step 2:** Read and analyze
```
Ask: "Read the access-log.txt and analyze the security patterns"
```

**Result:** Security insights, activity patterns, and recommendations

### **Example 3: Multiple File Comparison**

**Step 1:** Read several files
```
Ask: "Read all markdown files in my Financial-Analysis folder"
```

**Step 2:** Compare and analyze
```
Ask: "Compare these files and find common themes using analysis"
```

**Result:** Cross-file analysis, pattern identification, and insights

### **Example 4: Code Analysis**

**Step 1:** Read Python/code files
```
Ask: "Read my main.py file and analyze the code structure"
```

**Step 2:** Analyze architecture
```
Ask: "Use analysis to evaluate code quality, dependencies, and architecture"
```

**Result:** Code quality metrics, security analysis, and improvement suggestions

```

## üîç Advanced Analysis Techniques

### **Pattern Recognition**
- Identify recurring themes across documents
- Find security patterns in logs
- Detect configuration inconsistencies
- Analyze code quality patterns

### **Cross-File Analysis**
- Compare multiple documents
- Find relationships between files
- Identify missing components
- Track changes over time

### **Statistical Analysis**
- CSV data processing
- Financial data analysis
- Performance metrics
- Risk calculations

### **Content Extraction**
- Key information extraction
- Summary generation

## üìù How to Request Analysis

### **Simple File Reading**
```
"Can you read my [filename] and tell me what it contains?"
```

### **Targeted Analysis**
```
"Analyze my [filename] for [specific aspect - security, performance, etc.]"
```

### **Complex Analysis**
```
"Use the analysis tool to process my [filename] and extract [specific insights]"
```

### **Multi-File Analysis**
```
"Read all files in [folder] and find common patterns"
```

### **Data Processing**
```
"Load my CSV file and calculate [specific metrics]"
```

## üö® Security & Privacy

### **Safe Files to Analyze**
- ‚úÖ Configuration files (without credentials)
- ‚úÖ Documentation and guides
- ‚úÖ Code files
- ‚úÖ Log files (sanitized)
- ‚úÖ Analysis data

### **Files to Avoid**
- ‚ùå Personal financial data
- ‚ùå Authentication credentials
- ‚ùå Private correspondence
- ‚ùå Sensitive business information

## üí° Pro Tips

### **1. Be Specific**
Instead of: "Analyze this file"
Try: "Analyze this configuration for security issues and optimization opportunities"

### **2. Use the Analysis Tool for Complex Data**
For CSV, JSON, or complex calculations, specifically ask for the analysis tool:
"Use the analysis tool to process this data and calculate statistics"

### **3. Ask for Multiple Perspectives**
"Analyze this from both security and performance perspectives"

### **4. Request Actionable Insights**
"What specific actions should I take based on this analysis?"

### **5. Combine Multiple Files**
"Read these 3 files and find connections between them"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **File Not Found**
- Check the exact file path
- Use `list_directory` to see available files
- Ensure file is in `/Users/benitomartinlopez/Documents/Claude-Access/`

### **Analysis Not Detailed Enough**
- Ask specifically for the analysis tool
- Request specific metrics or insights
- Break complex analysis into steps

### **Large Files**
- For very large files, ask for specific sections
- Use the analysis tool for processing
- Consider breaking into smaller chunks

## üéØ Example Requests

### **Quick Analysis**
```
"What's in my access-log.txt file?"
```

### **Detailed Analysis**
```
"Read my trading platform configuration and use the analysis tool to evaluate the risk management settings, then provide recommendations for optimization"
```

### **Comparative Analysis**
```
