# 🚀 Enhanced RSI Stock Tracker - Mac App Creation Guide

Transform your Enhanced RSI Stock Tracker Python script into a proper Mac application that can be launched like any other app!

## 📋 Overview

You have several options to create a Mac app from your RSI tracker:

1. **PyInstaller** (Recommended) - Creates standalone executable
2. **py2app** - Mac-native app creation
3. **Manual App Bundle** - Simple wrapper (requires Python on system)

## 🎯 Quick Start (Recommended)

The easiest way is to use the automated installer:

```bash
# Make installer executable and run
chmod +x install_app.sh
./install_app.sh
```

This will automatically:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Build the Mac app bundle
- Offer to install it to Applications folder

## 📊 Detailed Options

### Option 1: PyInstaller (Standalone App)

**Pros:** Complete standalone app, no Python required on target system
**Cons:** Larger file size

```bash
# Method 1: Use the automated script
chmod +x create_mac_app.sh
./create_mac_app.sh

# Method 2: Use Python build script
python3 build_mac_app.py
```

### Option 2: py2app (Mac-Native)

**Pros:** More Mac-native, smaller size
**Cons:** More complex, requires specific setup

```bash
# Install py2app if not installed
pip3 install py2app

# Build the app
chmod +x build_with_py2app.sh
./build_with_py2app.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual App Bundle

**Pros:** Simple, quick to create
**Cons:** Requires Python 3 and dependencies on target system

```bash
chmod +x create_manual_app.sh
./create_manual_app.sh
```
